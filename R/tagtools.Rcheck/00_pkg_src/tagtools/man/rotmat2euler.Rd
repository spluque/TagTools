\title{Decompose a rotation (or direction cosine) matrix}
\usage{
rotmat2euler(Q)
}
\arguments{
\item{Q}{is a 3x3 rotation matrix.}
}
\value{
A 1x3 vector containing: prh=[p,r,h] where p is the pitch angle in radians, r is the roll angle in radians, and h is the heading or yaw angle in radians.
}
\description{
This function is used to decompose a rotation (or direction cosine) matrix into Euler angles, pitch, roll, and heading.
